Lorentzian Classification Strategy Specification:

1. Overview:
The Lorentzian Classification strategy is a machine learning-based trading algorithm that uses a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with Lorentzian distance metric, combined with kernel regression for signal generation and risk management.

2. Key Components:

   a. Feature Engineering (FeatureEngineer):
   - Processes raw market data into meaningful features.
   - Calculates technical indicators like RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc.
   - Handles any necessary data normalization or scaling.

   b. Machine Learning Model (LorentzianKNN):
   - A custom KNN classifier that uses Lorentzian distance metric.
   - Classifies market states based on engineered features.
   - Provides probability estimates for different market directions.

   c. Kernel Regression (NadarayaWatsonRationalQuadratic):
   - Non-parametric regression technique for estimating the relationship between features and target variables.
   - Used for smoothing predictions and identifying trends.

   d. Signal Generator:
   - Combines outputs from the ML model and kernel regression.
   - Generates buy/sell/hold signals for each asset.

   e. Trade Executor:
   - Implements the logic for entering and exiting positions based on generated signals.
   - Handles order placement and management.

   f. Risk Manager (LorentzianAdaptiveRiskManager):
   - Monitors and manages overall portfolio risk.
   - Adjusts position sizes based on market conditions and model confidence.

3. Process Flow:

   a. Initialization:
   - Set up the universe of tradable assets.
   - Initialize all components (feature engineer, ML model, kernel regression indicators, etc.).
   - Set up risk management parameters.

   b. Data Processing (OnData method):
   - Receive new market data for each bar.
   - Update feature sets using the FeatureEngineer.

   c. Model Update and Prediction:
   - Update the LorentzianKNN model with new feature data.
   - Generate predictions for each asset.

   d. Kernel Regression:
   - Update kernel regression estimates for each asset.

   e. Signal Generation:
   - Combine ML model predictions and kernel regression estimates.
   - Generate trading signals (buy/sell/hold) for each asset.

   f. Risk Assessment:
   - Evaluate current portfolio risk.
   - Determine appropriate position sizes based on risk parameters.

   g. Trade Execution:
   - Place orders based on generated signals and risk assessment.
   - Manage existing positions (exit or adjust as necessary).

   h. Performance Monitoring and Logging:
   - Track portfolio performance, individual trade performance.
   - Log important events, decisions, and current state.

4. Key Features:

   a. Lorentzian Distance Metric:
   - Used in the KNN classifier instead of Euclidean distance.
   - Better handles the non-linear nature of financial time series data.
   - More robust to outliers and sudden market changes.

   b. Adaptive Risk Management:
   - Adjusts risk parameters based on model confidence and market conditions.
   - Helps maintain consistent risk exposure across different market regimes.

   c. Multi-Asset Trading:
   - Capable of simultaneously trading multiple assets.
   - Allows for diversification and cross-asset insights.

   d. Feature Flexibility:
   - The feature engineering component can be easily extended to include new indicators or data sources.

   e. Kernel Regression Smoothing:
   - Helps reduce noise in predictions and identify underlying trends.

5. Parameters and Settings:

   a. Universe Selection:
   - List of symbols to trade (e.g., ["SPY", "AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "AMZN"])
   - Data resolution (e.g., Daily, Minute)

   b. Machine Learning:
   - Number of neighbors for KNN (e.g., n_neighbors=5)
   - Lorentzian distance weight

   c. Kernel Regression:
   - Lookback window (e.g., 20 bars)
   - Relative weighting parameter

   d. Risk Management:
   - Maximum drawdown
   - Maximum leverage
   - Volatility thresholds

   e. Trading:
   - Minimum holding period
   - Maximum holding period
   - Entry and exit thresholds

6. Potential Improvements and Extensions:

   a. Dynamic Feature Selection:
   - Implement methods to dynamically select or weight features based on their predictive power.

   b. Ensemble Methods:
   - Combine the Lorentzian KNN with other ML models for potentially improved predictions.

   c. Advanced Risk Models:
   - Incorporate more sophisticated risk models, possibly including options for hedging.

   d. Market Regime Detection:
   - Implement explicit market regime detection to adjust strategy parameters.

   e. Transaction Cost Modeling:
   - Include more detailed modeling of transaction costs and market impact.

   f. Alternative Data Integration:
   - Expand feature set to include alternative data sources (e.g., sentiment analysis, economic indicators).
